# OpenLens2030

**The future of microscopy — for everyone.**

OpenLens2030 is an open-source initiative to design and build a **low-cost, DIY, real-time electron microscope** capable of **x2,000,000 magnification** and **60fps imaging**, accessible to every human on Earth — and Mars — by the year **2030**.

## 🌍 Our Mission

To democratize nanoscopic and atomic-scale imaging by making advanced microscopy:

- ✅ Affordable
- ✅ Accessible
- ✅ Open-source
- ✅ Educational
- ✅ Scalable

## 🔬 What We're Building

- DIY-compatible electron microscope
- Real-time 60fps imaging via AI-enhanced electron diffraction
- Open-source hardware and software
- Modular, low-voltage, possibly vacuum-light
- Designed for education, research, art, medicine, exploration

## 🧠 Get Involved

We’re looking for:

- Hardware engineers (MEMS, EM, optics)
- AI & ML researchers (image enhancement, super-resolution)
- Open-source developers
- Educators & communicators
- Dreamers, hackers, and future-makers
